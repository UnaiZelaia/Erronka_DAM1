            Urbanism is and important and often overlooked subject when talking about sustainability. The way we
            organize our cities has a great impact in the emissions. Our goal is to spread awareness about this subject
            and educate people about subjects like car dependency, walkability, mass public transport and other subjects
            that are important to create a new and better world.

          <p>
            To combat the over-dependency on cars and the high emissions that come with it, the sustainable urbanism movement advocates to changes in 2 main directions: <b>Urban planning</b> that relies less on the use of the car and instead allows people to walk or bike short distances to meet their needs and high quality <b>public transport</b> that allow for medium to high distance travel at a fraction of environmental impact that an individual car has.

                <p>The center and perifery model for cities is deprecated and unsustainable. We advocate for medium
                  density cities where people don't have to travel long distances(and therefore, use lots of energy) to
                  meet their needs</p>

                <p>One of the best solutions to combat climate change is to reduce emissions by using public transport
                  as away to move from and to places. Here you'll learn how different kinds of public transport help us
                  be more sustainable</p>
