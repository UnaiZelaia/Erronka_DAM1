          <p>
            When creating new cities, it is important that authorities and goverment agencies create them with
            sustainability in mind. COncept like <b>Walkability</b>, and <b>Bikeability</b> are imperative in the
            creation of good cities that are sustainable. The less people have to move around, the less polution is
            going to be.

            <h2>Walkability</h2>
            <p>
              One of the most important part of a city is it's walkability. Walking is one of the most energy efficient
              methods of self transportation (excluding mass transport) and is good for one's health and the cities
              health. Studies have shown that walkable areas' bussinessess sell more and more often than those in areas
              difficult to reach by walking. Walking also provides a sense of community as people will often encounter
              each other walking to small businessess in the neighborhood instead of going alone to a massive
              supermarket where hundreds of thousands of people go to shop in bulk every day.

            <h2>Bikeability</h2>
            <p>
              When it comes to efficiency of self transportation, nothing beats biking. It is, like walking, very good
              for your health, and let's you reach much further away and faster than walking. It's also extremely safe,
              way more safe than cars. Moreover, is an extremely cheap transport method, and the advancement in electric
              motors over the last year have made biking more accesible to more people. Cities that are built with good
              bike lanes, face a way easier time maintaining their roads, since bikes don't destroy the roads as cars
              do.

          </header>
          <p>
            Another important point when making a sustainable city is population density. High density population areas
            where people don't have to move long distances to meet their needs are more efficient an polute less. Low
            population areas such as suburs and single home neighborhoods require their citizens to move long distances
            (often only attainable by moving in cars) to meet their needs, poluting more than high density areas. But
            most people want to live in a low stress location, without noise or having to live in an small apartment.
            That's where <b>medium density neighborhoods</b> come into play. In medium density areas, housing,
            entertaiment and shoping are mixed to offer the citizens the tranquility and stress free environment of a
            low density area, while offering all the services in walking or biking distance.
