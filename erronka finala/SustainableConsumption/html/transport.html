            Public transport is one of the best ways we can combat polution generated in transport. With public
            transport we can improve the traffic, noise levels, polution levels and space of our cities. Check out the
            main public transport alternatives.

            <h2>Train</h2>
            <h5>Efficiency on rails</h5>
            <p>The number one method of transport when it comes to medium to long distance travel. The train offers
              unprecedented confort to those who ride it, while being extremely efficient energy-wise. From regional
              trains to cross-country high speed rail, the train has helped reduce the carbon emissions a huge degree
              and it will continue to do so while we build more train lines and faster, more capacity trains. Learn more
              about the awesomeness of trains in the following link</p>

            <h2>Bus</h2>
            <h5>Adaptable and cheap</h5>
            <p>The bus offers a higly adaptable and ready to deploy public transport option in virtually any city or
              town where there are roads. Although not as efficient nor comfortable as the train, the bus is a great
              solution to transport people where rail lines cannot reach. They are also great when there is no
              infraestructure in place for better methods of transport, as a temporary solution while better
              alternatives are being built. It is also way cheaper than installing train lines, which makes it a very
              good options to deploy in zones where there is not sufficient invesment for better transport methods.

            <h2>Tram</h2>
            <h5>Gliding through the city</h5>
            <p>The tram is a great middle ground to move the population inside the city while being as efficient as the
              train, since it goes on rails. It thrives in small distance transport as a way for people to move from one
              part of the city to another. It's simple and effective. It is also extremely comfortable and low on
              emissions. A great alternative to cars inside the city center. You can learn more about trams in the next
